- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a programming error has very curious origins?
- In 1947, engineers on the Mark II computer team at Harvard University found a problem in their system: a bug got stuck in one of the relays, causing a malfunction.
- They actually found and removed the insect, and recorded it in their diary as the first documented instance of a "bug" in a computer system. Since then,
- the term "debugging" has been used to describe the process of finding and correcting errors in a program.
